6. 3.2 Installation and execution of Trojan program
Copy the generated Reptile64.out file to the target machine (1linux system) and install;
Here we take centos 7.6 x64 as an example:
1. Copy the files to centos 7.6 x64;
2. It needs to be installed with root permissions;
3. Enter the file directory and execute ./ Reptile64. out to install
(If CReptile64.out does not have execution permissions, you need to use the chmod +x Reptile64.out command to increase execution permissions)
Note: After the current installation is completed, a restart is required to take effect (the auto-start aspect still needs to be optimized later)
