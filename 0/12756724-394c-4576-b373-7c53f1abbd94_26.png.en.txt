Automatic penetration testing platform

2.3.2 Product functions

> Automated penetration: through a series of vulnerability scanning, vulnerability exploitation, permission acquisition, etc. on the target
The process discovers the targetâ€™s open ports and services, and based on the detected information, the system performs vulnerability analysis
Utilize to further obtain target permissions, the specific content is as follows

a) Vulnerability scanning

1) Quick scanning of vulnerabilities: for Windows hosts, Linux hosts, Web sites, and network devices
and other various targets, conduct quick scan tests to determine the host online status, port openness,
Operating system version and other information, and generate a report based on the results.

2) Detailed vulnerability scanning: The system has built-in tens of thousands of detection templates and vulnerabilities, supporting Web vulnerability scanning,
Operating system vulnerability scanning, weak password detection and other functions can detect all weaknesses and technologies of the system under test.
Actively analyze defects or vulnerabilities and generate reports including: host information, vulnerabilities
Assessment, vulnerability details, exploits, service list, port information, database information, documentation
File directory information, scan history, etc.

b) Exploiting vulnerabilities

1) Vulnerability verification: Vulnerability exploitation models with different risks can be customized and selected based on the vulnerability scanning results.
block to perform a penetration attack on the target vulnerability.

2) Import of scan results: The platform supports the import and export of scan results from a variety of third-party security scanning tools
Vulnerability verification, automatically identify and import reports, select imported hosts and corresponding vulnerabilities in the system
Perform penetration verification on the vulnerability, and attack after confirming that the vulnerability is real. Support includes: NSFOCUS Aurora,
