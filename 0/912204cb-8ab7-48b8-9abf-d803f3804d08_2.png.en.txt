1 Introduction









In the era of rapid development of information technology, network technology has also undergone earth-shaking changes with the update and iteration of technology. New technologies









Emerging one after another, driven by the rapid development trend of Internet technology, network penetration technology is also constantly innovating, and the current international situation







The potential is complex and network conflicts are happening every moment.

is one of the countries in the world, so there is an urgent need to establish a data query platform to provide powerful network attack and defense capabilities for network TZ business development.









combat ability.



Currently, there are many types of network security intelligence and other information. The GA team lacks channels to effectively improve search. Traditional searches are too cumbersome and cumbersome.

Has

Moreover, most of the information searched is repetitive and meaningless data, and important data is often difficult to find, thus making it impossible to achieve effective efficiency of TZ team members.















Therefore, in order to meet the current development trend of network TZ, create professional search software and build an integrated data platform.











It is urgent to innovate network information search through the construction of an integrated data platform for search and storage. Through the storage and search platform

















Technical means to implement storage and intelligent search modes help the network TZ team to effectively improve their actual combat capabilities and accumulate practical experience.
