The human-machine interface handles interaction with users, including user login, setting policies, and executing penetration. Operations such as testing and querying reports. for

























In order to improve the security of the system, the HTTPS protocol is used to communicate with the server.









The functional layer runs on the server and encapsulates the business logic modules of the network security assessment system, including control and management modules,







The information collection module, vulnerability analysis module, penetration attack module, and report generation module are the main body of the evaluation system and are responsible for responding to Web







client request.







The data layer is located at the bottom of the system framework, including database platform, database software and system data, and is responsible for storing data.











Manage, process and implement functional layer requests for data. The three-tier system structure of B/S can easily manage and maintain data.













Separating data and applications not only achieves system stability, but also improves system scalability, thereby improving system integrity.
