6) Malicious behavior screenshot function: If the imported file is found to have malicious behavior, such as file copying, the file



Take screenshots and record various malicious behaviors such as name modification.
4.1.4 Weapon resource management module
The weapons and equipment module is deployed on the external network platform, but the module is independent of other modules and provides a multi-login authentication mechanism.





















Only then can weapons and equipment be downloaded and used. The entire module provides weapon sandbox security detection functions, weapons library management functions, and weapons library
